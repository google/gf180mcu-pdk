4.6 Power supply pads and Corner pad
====================================

Each power supply pad, DVDD and DVSS has one ESD protection circuit inside. The leakage current of one ESD protection circuit is 648 nA maximum from simulation. Simulation conditions: FF corner, 5.5V at 125C.

Each corner pad has 2 ESD protection circuit inside. So total leakage current for each corner pad is 1296 nA maximum from simulation.
